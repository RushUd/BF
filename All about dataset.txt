3) Data Collection Methodology
	The data set was already available on kaggle and on github. 
	I did not create it, I will be using the dataset and making changes to it if needed.

4) Why does this data set intrigue you?
	This data set is about chamapgne sales for a particular company. I want to know, if there are any, sales trend hidden in the data set. Check if trends are 	seasonal. 

	This dataset particularly intrigues me as in the upcoming years I see myself working on such datasets for a company, finding trends, sales, etc. from the 	data and reporting it.
